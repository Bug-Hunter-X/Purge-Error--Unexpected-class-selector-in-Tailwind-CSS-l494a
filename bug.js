```javascript
// ...some Tailwind CSS classes...
<div class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Uncommon Error</h2>
  <p>This is some content.  The error might manifest here if you use an experimental or unsupported feature of Tailwind.</p>
  <p>For instance, this error could happen if you attempt to use a class that's not included in your `tailwind.config.js` purge settings, particularly if you're using a plugin that adds custom classes.</p>
</div>
